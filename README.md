# Hi!ðŸ‘‹
## I'm William Arnholt, a Networking student and a computer aficionado. I am currently enrolled in a Networking and Security Course and hope to one day become a Networking or Systems engineer.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on setting and imporving/simplyfying my setup, and trying to redo the way alot of my equipment is placed and configured.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in a vocational Networking and Security course as a first year learing about the fundamentals of computers. In this course I am working towrds a TestOut(now part of CompTIA) PC Pro Certification. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: here, or my soon(maybe??) being released website
- âš¡ Fun fact: At a summer invention camp where we were supposed to make something new from a item we took apart I disassembled and reassembled a entire PC. It was'nt perfect, however as a 6 year old I count it as a win.
